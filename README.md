 huffmanCoder coding project
 
 ##Description of the project. 
**Huffman coding** is a method of data compression that is independent of the data type.
This project is implement Huffman encoding by implementing **binary tree** data structure. will read and compress an input text file inputFileName, based on the Huffman encoding produced on the input file, and output the compressed file in outputFileName. 


##The output result.
it will take input file as txt format and output file can simply contain the characters “0” and “1”, instead of the binary bits.
